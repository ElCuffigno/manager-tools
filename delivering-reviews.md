# Delivering Performance Reviews

This is a tough task, and requires putting in the work. Need to be dedicated to management as a skill and responsibility. 

## Christmas Rule

Anything you only do once a year you'll be bad at. No practice.

Managing around EVENTS instead of PROCESSES is ineffective.
- Reactive, not proactive
- Take the Event, and miniize it's importance through the processs

## 2 Develop core message MOST IMPORTANT PART

This is the most important part. Most overlooked. 

Most emotionally charged meeting of the year. 

If you say something 7 times, half of your people will say they heard it once. 

Start with it, flesh it out, end with it.

Feedback a constant process. Should be able to take review and study it. They won't learn a lot from you in the meeting. 

Parts (three Rs)
1. Rating
- Overall score on org's rating system.
2. Result
- Classifications
 - Promotion
  - Promotion means you want to get them there, not that they are being promoted. (Doesn't mean you're promoting them immediately).
 - Vertical Growth
  - You want to give them more responsibility in the area they're already working. More delegating to them.
 - Horizontal Growth
  - Broaden responsibilities to take on more of what the organization is doing. Give you more work of a different type.
 - No Change
  - Ok for a first year of good progress but not ready to move into more responsibilites.
  - Second year of "no change" is time for a blunt conversation about their need to grow responsibilities.

"Other" ratings
- Reduce, demote, terminate
-- Usually happen outside of review schedule based on performance. 


- Classfications are how they're performance ranks, but 
- You're speaking for the organization.

3. Ramifications
-  Broad outlines of what you and the employee are going to do next year based on the result. 

Example: "Bob, you did a superior job last year and earned a Fully Exceeded (rating) rating. I feel
that means you're ready for vertical growth (result) in your role, in the areas of quality
control and variability reporting (ramification)."

Employee will NOT remember everything from this meeting. This is your way to get it delivered clearly. 

*Will they be able to repeat this one month after your meeting? *

## 3 - Logisitical Preparation

Reconfirm you have the room scheduled, and schedule for early in the review window. Don't schedule for first thing or EOD. 

If you can, sit on the same side of the table. 

## 4 - The Day Before

MUST give ratee the review the day before without pay info. EOD is ideal. Otherwise they'll come with questions. 

Go to their desk, hand it to them in a file folder, ask them to wait to read it until they're home, and remind them of the time tomorrow. 

## 5 What to Bring

- 2 copies of review form, one for each (with salary info)
- 2 copies of self evaluation, one for each
- Supporting materials (Job description, objectives, files, work materials, reports, projects, etc.)
- Your organized notes/observations
- Weekly O3 forms
- Quarterly Reviews
- Tissue
- Water
- Watch or clock. Nothing wrong with cutting this off at an hour. 

## 6 How to structure your delivery

- Go through areas you agree with their self evaluation first
- This gets you both comfortable
- This about delivering this message the same way as you do Feedback

"I rated you [x] in [skill] based on behaviors liike [examples], do you agree with that?"

Agreement is important, but not critical. You don't need it. If they don't agree with those, ask why. If mention other projects, you can go to your notes with more data to go through other examples. don't need agreement the second time.

Managers: DO NOT have only the behavioirs on the form as evidence. You need written backup. Data helps things go smoother.
