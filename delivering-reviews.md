# Delivering Performance Reviews

## Christmas Rule

Anything you only do once a year you'll be bad at. No practice.

Managing around EVENTS instead of PROCESSES is ineffective.
- Reactive, not proactive
- Take the Event, and miniize it's importance through the processs

## Prep 

Quarterly reviews?!?! 

Assumes you've done your prep work. 

Quarterly reviews - preferred by Manager tools. 

## Things to do

1. Pre-meeting email
2. Develop core message
3. Logistical prep
4. Day before review
5. What to bring to the reivew
6. How to structure your delivery
