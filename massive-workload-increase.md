## More details! 

This is more common than you think. Think about how you never go home with all your work done. You've been letting work not get done all along. Question is what work will get done. 

Delegation is one of the core aspects of management. 

Response to Workload Increase is the functionally the same as getting one big ball in the juggling koan.

Have to delegate to get through this. But don't delegate thing you were given.

Layoffs are sign of failure in understanding staffing needs.

Individual contributors delegate things to the floor.

Don't want too be in the middle and say no. Implies you're not in the workload cascade. 

Right choice is to assume the right work will get done, but there is some work that won't get done and it's ok.

Determine the right work to do. Leadership challenge is setting the tone to get it done. Believe it's all doable. 

## Episode 2

### Set example of positive mindedness

Whether you believe it or not, act as if it can be done. 

If we don't know it can't be done, it's our task as professionals to assume it can be done. 

## Meet with your team immediately and tell them what you know!

Be open and honest. Ok not to have a plan. Directs are likely scared, definitely scared if manager handles it poorly. 

Meeting in the next hour, call everyone in. Say: We can do this. 

Dampening panic and fear. 

If you can't brief the plan at this meeting, directs will assume you don't have one, so be up front about not having one. Tell them you don't have one but you're all going to work on it together quickly. And if it doesn't work we'll iterate. 

*Tell them we don't need negativity and you won't accept it.*

It's understandable, but don't be negative.

Got to be positive. Even if naturally pessimistic. 

Could do this in a series of smaller group meetings. Hand out agenda for any managers to give to there directs. 

Can't wait until you have a full plan together. 

Don't be part of negativity. Do not join in with any complaining. 

People may take shots at you from other departments/senior people. Stand up and take the comments. (If they're right, but said with venom... not just attacks). 

Don't complain to directs.

Reminds me of "Grips go up the chain of command, not down." 

Talk about the postitives with your boss. Don't take off the mask to show them that everyhing's on fire. This is a pretty rare need where you need to keep a brave face and convey real problems to boss. 

Behave as a professional all the time. 

People are going to complain, but you don't have to support, encourage, or model it.

The hard part is, you need to address the negativity and ask people to quit it. 

If you've got a relationship built, doing one on ones and giving feedback, you can give some negative feedback to get people to knock off negativity. 

You can also mention it during one-on-ones. 

Shotgun feedback at a team meeting is 100% bad. 

Managers bear more of the burden, but you don't need to take this home. Keep your worries outside. (worry tree)

## Part 3
### Don't assume everyhting can't be done

Don't start with a limited mindset. Start out with mindset that it can be done and there is a way. 

"I have no proof, but I believe it can be done" increases chances of being effective. 

Example of changing from driving to airport to taking cab and getting time back. 

You can find creative solutions.
- Possible minor reduction in quality to get more out
- Have lower-skilled tasks batched and performed quickly by other staff

Need to massage anger of internal customers when numbers are dipping due to vacations, etc. 

this is possible if you start with the attitude that you can be done. 

Trying can get you noticed, positively. It's a good example for the company, shows confidence for your internal management. 

"Be stupid enough or brave enough to set a goal."
