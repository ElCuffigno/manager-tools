# Massive Workload Increase

### Double workload and can't hire?

Dismissive of HR and concerns about mental health.

## 11 steps

1) Make the right choices 
2) Immediate example of positivity
3) don't complain or blame
4) Don't whine (with your directs)
5) Don't tolerate whining. Period.
   Blowing off steam together shouldn't be in playbook
6) Don't assume things can't be done (? May have missed this one
7) assume things can be done. (Picture right future)
8) Decide what you're willing to get in trouble for. (Be clear on priorities)
9) measure more
10) report more
11) Recognize this is a marathon not a sprint. It will go on longer than you think. 

## More details! 

This is more common than you think. Think about how you never go home with all your work done. You've been letting work not get done all along. Question is what work will get done. 

Delegation is one of the core aspects of management. 

Response to Workload Increase is the functionally the same as getting one big ball in the juggling koan.

Have to delegate to get through this. But don't delegate thing you were given.

Layoffs are sign of failure in understanding staffing needs.

Individual contributors delegate things to the floor.

Don't want too be in the middle and say no. Implies you're not in the workload cascade. 

Right choice is to assume the right work will get done, but there is some work that won't get done and it's ok.

Determine the right work to do. Leadership challenge is setting the tone to get it done. Believe it's all doable. 

## Episode 2

### Set example of positive mindedness

Whether you believe it or not, act as if it can be done. 

If we don't know it can't be done, it's our task as professionals to assume it can be done. 

## Meet with your team immediately and tell them what you know!

Be open and honest. Ok not to have a plan. Directs are likely scared, definitely scared if manager handles it poorly. 

Meeting in the next hour, call everyone in. Say: We can do this. 

Dampening panic and fear. 

If you can't brief the plan at this meeting, directs will assume you don't have one, so be up front about not having one. Tell them you don't have one but you're all going to work on it together quickly. And if it doesn't work we'll iterate. 

*Tell them we don't need negativity and you won't accept it.*

It's understandable, but don't be negative.

Got to be positive. Even if naturally pessimistic. 

Could do this in a series of smaller group meetings. Hand out agenda for any managers to give to there directs. 

Can't wait until you have a full plan together.
