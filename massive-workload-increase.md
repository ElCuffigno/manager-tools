## More details! 

This is more common than you think. Think about how you never go home with all your work done. You've been letting work not get done all along. Question is what work will get done. 

Delegation is one of the core aspects of management. 

Response to Workload Increase is the functionally the same as getting one big ball in the juggling koan.

Have to delegate to get through this. But don't delegate thing you were given.

Layoffs are sign of failure in understanding staffing needs.

Individual contributors delegate things to the floor.

Don't want too be in the middle and say no. Implies you're not in the workload cascade. 

Right choice is to assume the right work will get done, but there is some work that won't get done and it's ok.

Determine the right work to do. Leadership challenge is setting the tone to get it done. Believe it's all doable.
