# The Coaching Model - Revised

## Part 1 - 

Feedback takes seconds, coaching takes months.

Can be part of a one on one. 

Doesn't have to take forever to coach, just may take time to do. 

## The Model 
1. Collaborate to set a goal.
2. Collaborate to find resources.
3. Collaborate to create a plan.
4. Direct acts and reports on effectivness to act on plan. 

**Third pillar of manager trinity**

3 notes about it 
1. Purpose of coaching to encourage improved effectiveness.
2. Coaching more important than ever in discontinuous business environment.
3. They know people don't like the idea of coaching.

Great managers
- have great relationships with their directs
- Communicate regularly about performance
- consistently ask for notably increased performance. 

Lots of managers focus on top and bottom performers, but should be focused on everyone.

Managers manage by exception, but they should manage to opportunities. Spend time where you can have the most value/impact. That's always top performers. But they recommend spending time with everyone through one on ones.

Highly effective managers aren't looking to minimize time with directs. They demand top performance and reward it.

To improve performance of teams, coaching is the most effective way. 

Coaching has a negative connotation... I don't really have any preconceptions on this so I'm not sure why they're belaboring this.

Need to be clear this is to help develop everyone. 

##  Part 2 

Coaching most effective when collaborative.

Each have half the map, what the company wants and what the employee wants.

Keep it relaxed. Natural and comfortable.

### Goal

Sit down with direct and set a goal.

Describe behavior or task we want to achieve, then set a goal date.

"You will submit the capital plan without errors by 1 January."

Measurable and Time limited. (MT)

This is oversimplification but eliminates some overhead. Remove issue of quality. Can tighten up quality as you go.

Should be something that can be demonstrated. Have to do the goal, not just learn about it. Don't confuse with action steps.

Less than 8 weeks, could be covered with delegation and feedback.

Something that helps the company and employee.

Put goal on back of one on one forms.

First engagement, maybe try something they want to do, then it's the managers turn.

### Resources

Jointly brainstorm resources and direct trying them out. 2-3 minutes to come up with list of resources they think might be useful. Long list! Looking for volume not accuracy. 

There are no silver bullets.

Need to explore ways directs can pick up skills needed.

You may start a resource, find it's not useful, and discard. This is by design.

Managers don't have to be best at what they're coaching. That's the benefit of resources.

### Plan

Collaborate to create a plan.

Create first few weeks of the plan. 

Series of steps direct will take. 2-3 next steps. 

Can be simple as "order book by x date".

Recommend making them small.

Include reporting of the activity in the task. Report to me by...

### Act and Report

Direct acts on planned steps and reports. (No work for you).

You are not the trainer. You're the coach. 

As they achieve steps, give more feedback, iterate on resources.

If you miss the goal date, OK to move back as long as progress being made. 90% better is still better. 

## Discussion Notes

Top performer more relevant than I thought on my listen. Should be evaluating directs strengths and know who's top performing in what.

But, consider who you spend the most time on. 

Quantifying and setting deadlines for steps in plan is essential. Use DBQ:
- Deadline
- Behavior
- Quality 

Above measures success.

RP takes notes continuously. He keeps them private, but tracks feedback, performance. Helps a ton with EOY reviews. 

Manager and Direct should identify where and how the direct wants to go.
