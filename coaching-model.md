Great managers
- have great relationships with their directs
- Communicate regularly about performance
- consistently ask for notably increased performance. 

Lots of managers focus on top and bottom performers, but should be focused on everyone.

Managers manage by exception, but they should manage to opportunities. Spend time where you can have the most value/impact. That's always top performers. But they recommend spending time with everyone through one on ones.

Highly effective managers aren't looking to minimize time with directs. They demand top performance and reward it.

To improve performance of teams, coaching is the most effective way.
