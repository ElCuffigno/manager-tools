# Time Management

## Basics 

Hard to argue you should keep your job if you don't meet your priorities. 

Ask, what does this job require of me? 

Firedrills are how work gets done when we're not efficient. 

### Steps for Time Management
1 Roughly assess your time
2 Capture your priorities
3 Rough analysis
  a Druker analysis
4 Put No. 1 priority on calendar first

## Roughly assess your time

Simple step. Puts you in the right mindset

Sit with pen and paper (and NOTHING else) and ask "What do I spend my time doing?" 
  - Think over past 3 weeks
  - Think about workdays (Don't look at Outlook in advance).
  - You don't have your calendar going from meeting to meeting, so this simulates that.
  - Just a list of things you did. Not time you spent on it. 
  
Will discover time that you can't account for. You'll remember the ones that were most emotionally connected in most cases.

Spend 15-45 minutes. As many things as you did.

Used to not recommend, but if you don't do this first, you won't be ready for the next few steps. Thinking about work and time. 

Don't feel bad if you don't remember everything. 

## Capture your priorities

Gather 
  - job description, 
  - boss's job description, 
  - direct's job descriptions. 
  - Last few reviews. 
  - Any key metrics documents you report on. 
  - Last 10-15 Poiwerpoints you or your team have presented

If your job description is off base, shoot it over to your boss and see if it's time to update. Re-align to head off issues at review time. 

Powerpoints tell you what you've been working on. Help inform your current priorities. (In my case, this might be longer emails/meetings.)

**Take notes on key priorites** 
Capture everything, then aggregate into major categories and priorities.

Ok to have list of 50 tasks, but not more than *10* priorities. 

Key Priorities: ***5*** most important priorities.  **Write these down on a clean sheet of paper!**

Book "The effective executive" Peter Drucker

Walks through a more effective way for executives. 

What does this role require of me? What do I need to do to achieve that? Drucker says most effective executives only do 1 super well. some do 2. 3 is 'a circus act." 

How much time are you spending on No. 1?
