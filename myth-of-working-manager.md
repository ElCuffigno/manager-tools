# Myth of the "Working Manager"

All managers have duties beyond managing. 

Managing should be highest priority, and managing well will free up time.

You don't want to be a fire fighter all the time. This is selfish.

## delegating individual contributor work

Prioritization recommend: move managerial duties above the cut off line of things that doesn't get done. 

Your prioritization lines: Stuff you do, stuff you're responsible for that you delegate to others, stuff you don't do.

Ask self what each of my directs want to do, need to do, like to do.

Better at it than them at it isn't the standard for what should not be delegated. Standard is that the direct can do it as well as the first time you did it and they didn't fire you for it. 

Give them more stuff they like.

Managerial economics 101 podcast for why directs should manage them. 

Your job is to grow your team, not protect them. Grow them to the best of their abilities, knowing their strengths, and keeping them satisfied for retention.

Trust your directs to try.

Delegate our work to them, doesn't matter if they're busy. 

## delegating managerial work 

No brainiers:

- meetings & reporting

Running meetings as a manager is bad. When you run a meeting you are
- facilitating the meeting
- contributing content
- paying attention to directs, evaluating them

See cast on running the meeting

- Reporting

Producing the report creates no value above the data in the reports. 

Have directs produce reports, send to manager cc you, or if shocking results, send through you first.

Projects and presentations.
Great ways to show off directs. 
Get them experience doing next job.

## Summary
There no such thing as a non working manager

Change focus to being a working manager emphasize manager.
