# Delegation

## Part 1 - koan and model

Family is the sun

Imagine a box with 5 big grey balls and 15 small balls. 5 big are most important and glass. Box is 60 hour week. Can't add more. Given another big ball, orange (new).

Now what? Can't add it. Can't impact family time.

Hiring, race don't chase podcast. Can't hire our way out of issues.

Solution: 
- Delegation
-  Reprioritize
   - you setting aside 5 small balls and stopping the delegation cascade.
  - this is bad because your 5 small balls are more worthwhile, bigger than the 5 small balls at the lowest level 
 - stuff you work on is more important than 2 levels down in organization
   - "What about directs with no one to delegate to? What do they do?"
        - in principle this is right, but this hampers real delegation.
        - Everyone fills box to size they need to to seem busy. 
       - bottom of pyramid drops their least worthwhile tasks to do. Rank order them, manager chooses which to drop and is responsible for that decision. 
      - things people clung to get set aside and no one asks for them. *Delegate to the floor* 
   
- IT solution, just say no (bad)
     - say no. A career limiting move. If people can't delegate to you, you're a limiting factor on the business. CIO becomes CI-No, not CEO. 
    - More people. We should increase productivity, not labor costs. A lot of people think they need a new hire, but they don't. 

Delegation solutions
- give new big ball to direct (bad idea)
    - why bad idea? Because it's brand new to you. 
    - if new to you, what kind of resource would you be for your directs? A bad one. 
    -you're not ready, need to turn it to a task you know.
- delegate one of older but balls to direct (bad idea)
    - 

### The Good Idea
- delegate 5 small balls (= 1 big ball) gets rid of some responsibility. (Good idea)
  - now you're working on 6 important things!
  - balls increase in size and newness as you move them down an organization. 
   - 1 of your small grey balls is a big orange ball for your directs.  (And our new orange ball is a small grey to our boss).

If you fail to delegate, you're stopping the organization from growing. 

Good orgs are constantly growing and growth is stress.
