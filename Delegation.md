# Delegation

## Part 1 - koan and model

Family is the sun

Imagine a box with 5 big grey balls and 15 small balls. 5 big are most important and glass. Box is 60 hour week. Can't add more. Given another big ball, orange (new).

Now what? Can't add it. Can't impact family time.

Hiring, race don't chase podcast. Can't hire our way out of issues.

Solution: 
- Delegation
-  Reprioritize
   - you setting aside 5 small balls and stopping the delegation cascade.
  - this is bad because your 5 small balls are more worthwhile, bigger than the 5 small balls at the lowest level 
 - stuff you work on is more important than 2 levels down in organization
   - "What about directs with no one to delegate to? What do they do?"
        - in principle this is right, but this hampers real delegation.
        - Everyone fills box to size they need to to seem busy. 
       - bottom of pyramid drops their least worthwhile tasks to do. Rank order them, manager chooses which to drop and is responsible for that decision. 
      - things people clung to get set aside and no one asks for them. *Delegate to the floor* 
   
- IT solution, just say no (bad)
     - say no. A career limiting move. If people can't delegate to you, you're a limiting factor on the business. CIO becomes CI-No, not CEO. 
    - More people. We should increase productivity, not labor costs. A lot of people think they need a new hire, but they don't. 

Delegation solutions
- give new big ball to direct (bad idea)
    - why bad idea? Because it's brand new to you. 
    - if new to you, what kind of resource would you be for your directs? A bad one. 
    -you're not ready, need to turn it to a task you know.
- delegate one of older but balls to direct (bad idea)
    - 

### The Good Idea
- delegate 5 small balls (= 1 big ball) gets rid of some responsibility. (Good idea)
  - now you're working on 6 important things!
  - balls increase in size and newness as you move them down an organization. 
   - 1 of your small grey balls is a big orange ball for your directs.  (And our new orange ball is a small grey to our boss).

If you fail to delegate, you're stopping the organization from growing. 

Good orgs are constantly growing and growth is stress.

## Part 2 - How to Delegate

If you don't learn how to delegate as a manger, you will fail as an executive. Need to develop partnership skills and relationships.

Easy, but counterintuitive. 

Not all work from you is delegating. Most is assigning work (other podcasts about that). Assigning uses role power, but delegation is not the same. 

Delegation best achieved through relationship power. In principle, best way to do it is to ask direct to take over. Never ask a question whose answer you don't intend to honor. If they say no, we're going to walk away. 

### Steps
1. State your desire for help from your directs. 
  - Bob I'd like your help.(not a favor)
  - if your boss came and asked in a polite way, would you be open to it?
2. Tell them why we're asking them specifically. 
  - something they're good at, want to get better at it, or need to improve at it. 
  - Need want like concept
  - thought about it carefully, and just a quick assertion of your reasons.
  - ask for specific acceptance of the responsibility
3. Ask without giving details.
  - would you please take over _task_
  - don't give all the details
  - they say yes or no, but asking first is better. (80% say yes).
  - giving full details causes people to listen defensively. 
  - they said yes, listening actively.
  - if *no*, ask about their concerns. Affirm. Then see if you can resolve them. But if you get a true no, you're not pushing it. 
  - This isn't manipulation. It's persuasive power. Assumes you're picking the person for a good reason. 
  - objectionss are a clue to concerns, you can address concerns while giving details.
4. Describe task in detail.
  - describe what's involved in detail while addressing concerns. 
  - not shy about giving him too much to do. This fuels growth. Want people between comfort and stressed. 
  - in a world with too little to do, people spend time on the wrong things.
  - without stress of more to do, won't get direct to drop least important tasks
5. Deadline, quality and reporting standards
  - when, how good, 
6. What do you need from me?
  - skill and resource needs.
  - be careful. Avoid reverse delegation. 
  - they may push things back to you.

Don't be concerned that quality might dip. Maybe it's as bad as your first times at the task, but the organization will survive. 

Making mistakes under your cover.

In a few months, quality will come back up, and you're saving time for you and they'll be ready for their next task. Gotta prepare for promotion. Delegate running meetings and running projects to directs to teach them. 

Have to delegate to grow.

Paired with lots of feedback, coaching. Follow up. Keep pushing people. 

State desire for help. State why you're picking them. Address concerns. Let people fail under your auspices.
