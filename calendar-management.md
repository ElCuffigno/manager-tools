# Calendar Management 

## Shorten Free Times

### 1. Continous, unscheduled time - "Billion time"
  - Don't schedule your days with blocks towards this.
  - Don't try to keep big swatches open.
  - Don't move things to get more unscheduled time. 
  - DON'T DO EMAIL DURING IT.

We aren't effective, because the longer we have to do it, the longer it will take. 

Professional's job is to make a good stress (Eustress (deadlines), not distress (panic)). 

As you advance, you'll have less free time.

**There is no free time.**

Suggesting there will be some slack, but don't schedule more than 90 min at a time free. Unlearn joy of free time.

Break it up. Schedule what matters. 

### 2. What to do with unscheduled time

Put time on there for your priorties. 

Don't fill the whole time, keep some slack. 

What to put on your calendar: 
- Put time on calendar for Family
- Put time on there for Email.
- Put key priorities on your calendar

**Break up unscheduled time.**
 - Move meetings around
 - Don't do email during that time.
 
 Email is worst thing you can do with unscheduled time. 
 Many are in culture where email is key, but recommend it's not. 

*Don't wish for longer. Wish for faster.* 

## Priorities in the morning

1. Schedule time proactively (for priorities
2. Schedule them for the morning.
3. Keep blocks less than 90 minutes
4. Ok to schedule alone time, but *Need to honor it*
  - Can't just tick off little things. Feels good, but not good in long run.

Calendar managment errors: 
1. See it as only a way to keep track of meetings.
2. Used reactively
  - Where you find out what meetings other people are expecting you to go to.
  - Becomes another inbox. 
  - Have to be proactive about calendar. 
  
It's a resource allocation tool. *You* allocate the resource of your time. Even if you do this, you won't get all of your tasks and responsibiliities completed. 

What am I willing to get in trouble for? Is A more or less important than B? If A is more important, and I leave that undone, is it ok that I got B, the unimportant thing, done? 

If you think the above, you'll put time on your calendar so you can stick to your plan, and accomplish most important things. 

### Recommendation
Sit down, once a week, and think about your next 2 weeks. 

Sunday night, look at next two weeks. IF you look at the next week, you'll likely not have time for things until Thursday the first week, so plan them to the next week.

What are your top priorities? Are they on your calendar? 

### Why the morning?
Let's face important things while we're fresh. 

Afternoon meetings more likely to be trumped. 

Use today for today. Pick 2 things and get them done in the morning! 

### Other Recommendations

- No more than an hour in the afternoon and 90 minutes in the morning between breaks. 
- Things that require focus better for morning. 
- YOU CAN SCHEDULE TIME FOR YOURSELF.
  - Do your best to honor it. 
  - Stick to it! 

## Misc.
Every email you send requires work for someone else.
