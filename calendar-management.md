# Calendar Management 

## Shorten Free Times

### 1. Continous, unscheduled time - "Billion time"
  - Don't schedule your days with blocks towards this.
  - Don't try to keep big swatches open.
  - Don't move things to get more unscheduled time. 
  - DON'T DO EMAIL DURING IT.

We aren't effective, because the longer we have to do it, the longer it will take. 

Professional's job is to make a good stress (Eustress (deadlines), not distress (panic)). 

As you advance, you'll have less free time.

**There is no free time.**

Suggesting there will be some slack, but don't schedule more than 90 min at a time free. Unlearn joy of free time.

Break it up. Schedule what matters. 

### 2. What to do with unscheduled time

Put time on there for your priorties. 

Don't fill the whole time, keep some slack. 

What to put on your calendar: 
- Put time on calendar for Family
- Put time on there for Email.
- Put key priorities on your calendar

**Break up unscheduled time.**
 - Move meetings around
 - Don't do email during that time.
 
 Email is worst thing you can do with unscheduled time. 
 Many are in culture where email is key, but recommend it's not. 

*Don't wish for longer. Wish for faster.*
