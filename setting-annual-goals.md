# Setting Annual Goals

## We don't like SMART goals

Annual review time grinds orgs to a halt while figuring out what they can do. 

Goals need to be vertically shared to be sure we're all rowing in the same direction and trying to acheive the same ultimate goals.

"BLUF" (Bottom Line Up Front)

They Recommend "MT" goals

## MT Goals

MT Goals are the M and T of smart goals.

1. Measurable
2. Time-bound

Any goal should be measurable and bound by time (have a deadline). These are the heart of smart goals. 

Not too many managers come up goals that are not relevant or achieveable.

## SMART Goals (are stupid)

Specific, measurable, achieveable/attainable, relevant/realistic/results-oriented, time-based/tangible

A goal that meets all 5 criteria better than one that doesn't, but you can do better. 

Makes you think about your goals. 

Metrics are hilariously applied, but can move people towards improvement. 

T = must be time-based. Goals need deadlines. M & T are the only important parts. 

Big issue is that many of these SMART goals become overly complex and word-smithed to the point of vaguery and uselessness. 

SMART = "Improve functions in outbound freight order processing to reduce negative impact of not meeting 80% ship accuracy plant standard."

MT = "Improve ship accuracy to 85% by October 30th"



### Specific

Goal should addresss something direct and related to your work that's easily understood. Encourages you to think granularly not tied to a bunch of measures.

### Measureable

Means you can measure it. They aren't fans of "improve" because it's not measureable. 

Goal isn't "better than previous performance", goal is about hte difference between past and future.

### Achieveable 

Maybe your roll can't double reveues in 2 weeks...

Fence swinging may be punished if missed in many orgs.

### Relevant/Realistic/Results-oriented

Relevant - your boss will take care of this.

Realistic - Same as A?

Results-oriented - some value in measuring the output of your actions... but don't love it.

### Time-based/Tangible 

Time-based = deadline

Tangible = softer than time based. Something you can 'feel or touch'. But with no time constraints, this is a disaster.
