# Setting Annual Goals

## We don't like SMART goals

Annual review time grinds orgs to a halt while figuring out what they can do. 

Goals need to be vertically shared to be sure we're all rowing in the same direction and trying to acheive the same ultimate goals.

"BLUF" (Bottom Line Up Front)

They Recommend "MT" goals

## MT Goals

MT Goals are the M and T of smart goals.

1. Measurable
2. Time-bound

Any goal should be measurable and bound by time (have a deadline). These are the heart of smart goals. 

Not too many managers come up goals that are not relevant or achieveable. 

Simplicity is impressive and the end product will be SMART. 

### Time-bound

*Every goal has a deadline that is a specific date within the coming calendar year.*

Not implied dates, not Q3. A number between 0 and 32 with one of the 12 months of the year next to it.

### Measureable

These are so important we must **create them** if you haven't already. 

Best place to start is where the organization already has measures in place. 

Look at those measures and set a higher standard than has already been set and achieved. 

We either set a standard against an existing goal, or create a new metric (metric not the goal, the delta in the metric is the goal). 

Recommnedations for metrics:
1. The best metrics are numbers
- Everyone gets numbers
2. Zero is a number
- Challenges people, inspires them to get to zero. 
- Eliminate anothe good word for this. 
3. Consider Proxies to get to a number
- Measuring something else that you believe accurately represents something, without being the THING itself (e.g., less complaints = higher quality. Fewer bugs = higher quality. Book to bill, new housng starts, any economic metrics).
4. Consider surveys
- Way to get a number for something we don't otherwise have a number for. 
- Generally well received as measures, but a LOT of work.
5. Reduce costs
- Recommend every manager every year have a goal relative to costs and that goal should be to reduce costs. 
- Growing costs more slowly counts!
- Know your costs and have a way to attack them.
6. Avoid "improving" things
- *Do not use: boost, correct, develop, elevate, enhance, grow, help, increase, revamp, revise, update, upgrade.*

Recommendations for goals: 
a. Stay Narrow
- Come up with 3 goals you will DIE for, not a ton of goals. 
- Choose an area of focus. GOing to have cureveballs, so don't get caught up with those and too many goals.
b. Plan for by Q4 completion
- Aim for completion start of Q4! 
- Good amount of wiggle room. 
- Worst case, you fail to meet a goal becaue you're late, but you'll have time to wrap it up before your review. 
c. Backwards Plan
- Pick the end date. What do you have to do just before that? And before that? And before that? 
- Set timelines of these things. You'll be wrong, but that doesn't mean you've met the goal. 
d. Frontload Tasks
- Try to get everything done by the start of q4.
- this give s you room for curveballs.

## SMART Goals (are stupid)

Specific, measurable, achieveable/attainable, relevant/realistic/results-oriented, time-based/tangible

A goal that meets all 5 criteria better than one that doesn't, but you can do better. 

Makes you think about your goals. 

Metrics are hilariously applied, but can move people towards improvement. 

T = must be time-based. Goals need deadlines. M & T are the only important parts. 

Big issue is that many of these SMART goals become overly complex and word-smithed to the point of vaguery and uselessness. 

SMART = "Improve functions in outbound freight order processing to reduce negative impact of not meeting 80% ship accuracy plant standard."

MT = "Improve ship accuracy to 85% by October 30th"



### Specific

Goal should addresss something direct and related to your work that's easily understood. Encourages you to think granularly not tied to a bunch of measures.

### Measureable

Means you can measure it. They aren't fans of "improve" because it's not measureable. 

Goal isn't "better than previous performance", goal is about hte difference between past and future.

### Achieveable 

Maybe your roll can't double reveues in 2 weeks...

Fence swinging may be punished if missed in many orgs.

### Relevant/Realistic/Results-oriented

Relevant - your boss will take care of this.

Realistic - Same as A?

Results-oriented - some value in measuring the output of your actions... but don't love it.

### Time-based/Tangible 

Time-based = deadline

Tangible = softer than time based. Something you can 'feel or touch'. But with no time constraints, this is a disaster.
