# One on Ones

## Part 1

One on ones are the most highly recommended tools to managers

Good managers know the strengths/weaknesses of their teams and learn these by building a relationship with them.

One on ones are weekly deposits to emotional bank account with employees.

*Recommendations*

One on ones should be:
- Weekly
  - Consistency shows importance/respect
  - Frequent enough that they aren't something to prep a lot for, but gives directs time to prep if needed


- Scheduled
  - shows commitment and importance of the meeting
  - Even if needs to move, keeps the meeting on people's minds
  - Gives right of first refusal

## Part 2

Can't replicate/multitask the time

These are business meetings.
One of the most important meetings of the week.

Sends signal that relationships with directs are important all the time.

weekly
- Don't reschedule for the following week
- Rarely missed

### What do I do?
If it's for a relationship, why do I need a structure?

This is professional relationship, so we have an agenda.

Monday one on ones most likely to get hijacked.

#### **Agenda**
- 10 minutes for them.
- 10 minutes for you.
- 10 minutes about the future.

Always serves the purpose of the meeting

10 for them
- If you went first, you'd take too much
- if they're still talking after 10, let them go. let them talk the whole time for weeks to build the relationship.
  - first month, whole time
  - second month, let them know at 20one-on-ones
  - 3rd, stop at 20
  - 4th, ask for 15.
- You can talk to them whenever you want.

Can be 15/15 minutes, and might most times, but when there is time, talk about hte future.

*Recommendations*

Always start the one on ones with the same first question:
Example: "How's it going?"

Vague and benign question showing that you're turning the meeting to them.

Keeps the agenda, prevents you from hijacking the meeting for your plans.

Let the person do what they want to do, even if they're talking about their personal stuff. And note what's important.

## Part 3

Your 10 minutes:
- Of course talk about work but...
- Don't be a robot.

10 minutes for the future
- Where do you want to be in a year?
- What have you done to get there? Consider it a project

#### **Where to do them?**

They should be public, not private as in hidden. Ok to have in a public place where you'd have a private conversation. (Coffee shop, cafeteria, etc.)

If you're in a public place, the ambient noise should cover it up.

Don't recommend shared resource like a conference room. These can be commandeered by higher ups.

If people aren't sharing, it's you. Not the space.

If they're remote, try a phone/skype one on one, not as good, but better than nothing when you can't be face to face.

## Q&A
*Bad performance*

People are hungry for feedback.

You can give them feedback in any order, but if it's regular, they'll feel like you're talking about "work" not "them".

If you always give good news first, people will ignore good comments and look for other shoe to fall.

Always take notes. Gotta fight through the awkwardness of it. They may be worried about documenting it. Next one on one promised you I would do X, and give feedback on it. That helps alleviate issues.

Follow up on old items
- Write it down
- Prepping for next meeting, circle what you need to cover

If you apologize and don't do it, lose credibility. Give the feedback that it's ok to be late.

One on one facilitates feedback. Gives an opportunity for feedback.

Not the only time to talk to folks, but can funnel talk into this if people are taking up all your time.

If someone doesn't show up? Assume responsible adult. Reschedule for the same week.

Save notes and refer to them for effective one on ones.
