 # Feedback

## episode 1

Feedback isn't for the issue in the past. It's for the future.

"Can I give some feedback? You did x, it had affect y, next time do z."

If you are angry, or have an edge, it's perceived as punishment. This causes avoiding punishment, so they may do the poor behaviour again. (And cover it up!)

Don't sandwich negative in praise.

Praise not effective for greater productivity. If you want them to do it again, explicitly tell them.

Productive employees happier than unproductive. *Happiness does not increase productivity.*

Recommend starting with only positive feedback to learn the way it works. Makes it easier for you.

## Episode Two

Question, behavior, impact, new behavior or commit to same.

Negative feedback: assume that's the outlier.

No scaling up. Just repetition. Repeated 6 or 7 times before escalating. Don't wait for pattern.

Like a steering wheel. Make small adjustments.

Asking to encourage effective future behavior. Makes sure they have the time and attention to get the feedback at that moment. Prevents distractions.

If they say no:
- walk away
- don't need to bring it up if the behavior stops
- consistent small feedback means small corrections, so OK to miss here and there.
- more than a week, forget it.

After a week, not.needed

## episode three

Feedback on behavior, not attitude.

We don't pay for why. We pay for outcomes.

Starting with "When You" makes it easy to focus on the behavior.

I phrases are from social psychology, not organizational, healthy psychology. Don't start with "I feel..." or "I think...". You're talking about their behavior, not attitude. 

### Attitude vs behavior

Angry is an emotion, not a behavior. They can always say "I wasn't angry/upset/whatever", that's a losing battle with no feedback.

5 Behaviors to review:
 - the words you say
    - There's a difference between "I will" and "I think I will
 - how you say those words
    - tonal inflection, loudness, speed. Subtext.
    - "I didn't say you had an *attitude* problem" vs "I didn't say *you* had an attitude problem."
 - facial expressions
 - body language
    - the two above replace emotional words
    - "you were angry" vs "you rolled your eyes and crossed your arms and the client didn't like it."
 - work product
    - the quantity of your work
    - how much stuff someone did
    - Quality of work also behavior
    - Accuracy
    - Timeliness
    - all documents
    - Relationships
        - internal and external
        - if you have a bad relationship with customer service people
