 # Feedback

## episode 1 - The Model

Feedback isn't for the issue in the past. It's for the future.

"Can I give some feedback? You did x, it had affect y, next time do z."

If you are angry, or have an edge, it's perceived as punishment. This causes avoiding punishment, so they may do the poor behaviour again. (And cover it up!)

Don't sandwich negative in praise.

Praise not effective for greater productivity. If you want them to do it again, explicitly tell them.

Productive employees happier than unproductive. *Happiness does not increase productivity.*

Recommend starting with only positive feedback to learn the way it works. Makes it easier for you.

## Episode Two - Question opening

Question, behavior, impact, new behavior or commit to same.

Negative feedback: assume that's the outlier.

No scaling up. Just repetition. Repeated 6 or 7 times before escalating. Don't wait for pattern.

Like a steering wheel. Make small adjustments.

Asking to encourage effective future behavior. Makes sure they have the time and attention to get the feedback at that moment. Prevents distractions.

If they say no:
- walk away
- don't need to bring it up if the behavior stops
- consistent small feedback means small corrections, so OK to miss here and there.
- more than a week, forget it.

After a week, not.needed

## episode three - Behavior

Feedback on behavior, not attitude.

We don't pay for why. We pay for outcomes.

Starting with "When You" makes it easy to focus on the behavior.

I phrases are from social psychology, not organizational, healthy psychology. Don't start with "I feel..." or "I think...". You're talking about their behavior, not attitude. 

### Attitude vs behavior

Angry is an emotion, not a behavior. They can always say "I wasn't angry/upset/whatever", that's a losing battle with no feedback.

5 Behaviors to review:
 - the words you say
    - There's a difference between "I will" and "I think I will
 - how you say those words
    - tonal inflection, loudness, speed. Subtext.
    - "I didn't say you had an *attitude* problem" vs "I didn't say *you* had an attitude problem."
 - facial expressions
 - body language
    - the two above replace emotional words
    - "you were angry" vs "you rolled your eyes and crossed your arms and the client didn't like it."
 - work product
    - the quantity of your work
    - how much stuff someone did
    - Quality of work also behavior
    - Accuracy
    - Timeliness
    - all documents
    - Relationships
        - internal and external
        - if you have a bad relationship with customer service people

## Episode Four - Outcomes

Steps 2 and 3 are here's what we did, and here's the outcome.

If you don't give feedback, internal processes of the company don't match market model for products.

You did an action, here's the market response.

Lateness impacts projections, revenue, and costs. So occasional lateness doesn't help.

Don't get paid for intent.

THE MODEL

Can I give you feedback?
When you...
Here's what happens...

Here's what happens becomes implied over time, but it's good to start with that.

*Faster is better*

Don't need a laundry list of outcomes. Outcome can be, "it really helps me out."

Simple. Direct.

Easiest one is to describe impact on you.  "Worries me". You can describe your attitude in outcomes. 

If feedback is unclear, step three gives positive or negative.

Step 4:
Reinforce about the future.

*Positive:* say thanks ("keep it up", etc')

*Negative:* ask them to do it differently next time.

**Simple:** Could you change that? Can you? Would you? Will you? 

don't ask open ended question

Asking a question gets their commitmen,  take responsibility, and implied agreement old behavior is ineffective. Simple answer is yes.

If they say no? Big problem,  but super rare. 

Being casual helps them think less about if this is punishment or not. This seems a but phoney when he says it but makes sense.

## Revisited - Q&A

Don't rise to the bait. These aren't discussions. 

*My previous manager didn't expect me to do that.*

General guidance, you'll be different than the previous manager. This means nothing to you. 

Simple response: Well, that makes sense that that's why you've been doing X, but I'm asking you to try Y, can you commit to that? 

*I have plenty of other stuff to do*

This doesn't mean they can't change the way they're doing something.  

"I respect that, and that's fine, but being part of a team means you sometimes need to change behavior. what can you do to change that?" 

I don't need to win a battle with subordinates. 

*I don't want to*

Pretty bold, unlikely. Power move. 

"I gather that, in that you're not doing it any differently. I've given you the outcome of what you do, how can you do that differently?"

*let me think about it*

"I don't know what their is to think about. I've asked you to do Y. Can you do that?" 

**Giving Feedback like breathing. So comfortable and so oftern it's no big deal.**

If repeating same feedback often, don't lose temper. 
Stage 2 feedback: 
"Hey, when I ask you to do X, and you say 'Yes', but don't do it, here's what happens: (Normal outcomes), *but I also wonder if you are committed to this and have a willingness to change*. What can you do about this?" 

Stand firm with niceness. 

Still just feedback. Not escalating to disciplinary behavior. 

If you can't get a commitment, remind "Well, if you're *trying* and you can't do it for the next few weeks, we're back in the same spot."

*I don't want praise*
There are people on the team who do not want to be praised in public. Don't want the spot light. 

They still want/need praise, but just in their way. 


**Rolling out**

Walk them through the 4 steps, then start trying it out.

Start mostly positive.

Team reactions may be fearful at first. 



## Our Discussion

9:1 positive to negative ratio is the (exaggerated) goal.
